# Reinforcement Learning Demos

A collection of Jupyter Notebook scripts used to demonstrate reinforcement learning (RL). Open each notebook (either locally or with Google Colab) and execute each of the cells. Note that if you are executing locally, you will need to install [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

To get started with RL, please watch the [following video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3av8vozEczU):

The video walks through the [cartpole notebook](rl-demo-cartpole.ipynb). At the end, viewers are encouraged to modify that notebook to solve the [inverted pendulum problem](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/classic_control/pendulum/). I highly recommend trying this on your own before looking at my solution in the [pendulum notebook](rl-demo-pendulum.ipynb).

A discussion of the pendulum solution can be found here %%%LINK%%%.
